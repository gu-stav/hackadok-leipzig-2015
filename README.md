# Result of the DOK Hackathon 2015 in Leipzig
We, as team 6, worked during this Hackathon on a diffent user-interface, which shows up the possibilities facebook
has to monitor it's users. It's an interactive movie, where you have to login at the beginning with your personal
facebook account. Afterwards your friends and their data (this prototype only uses samples) are the actors.

## Team 6
Bela Usabaev, Rowena Crowe, Katarzyna Boratyn & Gustav Pursche
